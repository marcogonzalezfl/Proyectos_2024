# Crime Trend Analysis in South Africa (2005-2016)

This project aims to analyze and visualize the crime trends across South African provinces from 2005-2016.

## Objectives:
- Analyze the evolution of crime in different categories (e.g., Burglary, Arson).
- Visualize the trends over time and by province using line plots and animated GIFs.

## Tools:
- `pandas`: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting.
- `imageio`: For creating animated GIFs.

## Setup:
1. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib imageio geopandas
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/crime_data_analysis.py
   ```

## Output:
The outputs will be saved in the `outputs/` folder. These include:
- PNG files of the crime trend plots.
- GIFs of crime trends by province.
